## 🚀 What is Quze?  

**Quze** is an advanced penetration testing framework developed by **CyberHeroes**.  
It **does NOT use Quantum Computing** but applies **quantum-inspired techniques like probabilistic optimization and adaptive payload mutation** to evade security defenses.  

✅ **Quze is powered by AI, not real Quantum Computing.**  
✅ **Designed to bypass high-level security systems like WAFs & AI-based detection.**  
✅ **Learns and adapts from target responses to maximize exploitation success.**

## 🔥 Key Features  

### **🤖 AI Payload Mutation**  
✔ **Continuously evolves payloads to avoid detection.**  
✔ Uses AI-driven transformations to **generate unique attack vectors dynamically.**  

### **🕵️ Autonomous Reconnaissance**  
✔ **Automatically identifies security vulnerabilities.**  
✔ AI-driven analysis helps **adapt attack methods based on the target.**  

### **🏹 Evasive Payloads**  
✔ Payloads are crafted to **bypass signature-based and behavior-based detections.**  
✔ **Obfuscation techniques** ensure stealth execution.  

### **💻 Remote Command Execution**  
✔ **Execute commands on the target without leaving forensic traces.**  
✔ Utilizes hidden communication channels for stealth operations.  

### **🎭 Advanced Cloaking & Obfuscation**  
✔ Payloads are disguised as **legitimate traffic.**  
✔ **Defeats anomaly detection and AI-powered monitoring.**
