## 📌 What is Quze?
**Quze** is an **penetration testing** framework being developed by CyberHeroes that integrates **AI and Quantum Computing** to **bypass security, encryption, exploit networks, and analyze systems**.

## 🎯 Key Features
| 🔥 Feature | 🛠️ Description |
|------------|---------------|
| 🤖 **AI Payload Mutation** | Uses an **AI model** to develop advanced payloads that are hard to detect. |
| 🔐 **Quantum Encryption** | Encrypts payloads using **quantum-based encryption techniques**. |
| 🕵️ **Autonomous Reconnaissance** | Automatically analyzes the target to find security vulnerabilities. |
| 🏹 **Evasive Payloads** | Generates **dynamic payloads that are hard to detect** by WAF/IDS. |
| 💻 **Remote Command Execution** | Can execute commands on the target server through **Shell.php**. |
| 🌍 **Distributed Attack** | Uses **multi-threading** for simultaneous attacks on multiple targets. |
